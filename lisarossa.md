I came from Indonesia
1,5 years and I live in Leuven while studying Sustainable Development at KU Leuven
I have no idea, but I would like to use my programming skills for addressing urban problems or solving sustainable issues (because it is my background academic)
“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.” – Mark Twain.
